# ZeroStrainData

In our submitted work "Design principles of zero-strain Li-ion cathodes of an FCC anion framework", we have developed a cluster expansion model for quantifying the volume change as a function of composition. The raw data and code for reproducing our cluster expansion fitting have been provided in this repo

## Data Files
* `LVNOF_rawdata.csv`: DFT computed data of DFT energies and volumetric change for compositional space of Li-V-Nb-O-F

* `available_code.ipynb`: The code for regenerating the cluster expansion fitting of volumetric change from the raw data provided by "LVNOF_rawdata.csv"
